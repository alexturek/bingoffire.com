<h2>What's Bing of Fire?</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It7107ELQvY">
Thanks Johnny!</a></p>

<h2>What's a jianbing and how do you pronounce it?</h2>
<p>"Gee-n-bing" Jianbing... are these tasty Chinese pancake/crepe/burrito thing you get from street vendors in China early in the morning.</p>

<h2>Where do you set up?</h2>
<p>Around Seattle, though I'm in different locations most days. I'd recommend hitting up the <a href="https://twitter.com/BingofFire">Twitters (@bingoffire)</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bing-of-Fire/502888773079831">Facebook</a> for the latest news.</p>

<h2>Why'd you get into this?</h2>
<p>Selfish reasons mostly.  I was walking through a US airport early in the morning saying, "Man I would love a jianbing right now." Nobody in Seattle was really making it. I've seen it on some menus in restaurants, but it's not the same as getting it from a cart. </p>

<h2>Are you Chinese?</h2>
<p>Nope. I just enjoy Chinese food. I did spend some time in China, teaching English, traveling and eating.  Lots of eating.</p>

<h2>Future plans?</h2>
<p>Night market! I love the idea of a bunch of food trucks and carts in the same parking lot creating a night market where friends/family can go and pick out their own food. There'd be lights, tables, some canopies. A friendly atmosphere for all.  Love it.</p>
